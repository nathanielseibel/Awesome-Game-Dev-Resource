## Gameplay Programmer

This type of programmer is focussed in on the gameplay mechanics. They take the direction from the lead designers, coupled with the ideas of the writers, to make mechanics that make sense in game. Their also focused on balancing and tuning gameplay. This means that they review bug reports throughout development and post launch to help optimize the game. A gamplay programmer, not only has the job of helping the game work, but also the job of keeping the game working for as long as it is supported.

## Game Engine Programmer

More common as a standalone group of programmers in years past, the Game Engine programmer develops the engine in which the game runs. More modernly, this position is one for specific engine familiarity. In the case of the former, these programmers will lay the groundwork which runs the game as it is developed. With the latter, these programmers will have a high level of knowledge on the specific uses and ways to work within specific engines. Depending on the engine, this could mean a high level of coding experience, or the capacity to understand the interactions of simplified programming forms (i.e. Blueprint).

## Environmental Artist

These individuals help to create the worlds in which a game takes place. They work closely with creative directors and level designers to map out landscapes, either 2D or 3D, that suit the game. They can work with various photo editing softwares, 3D modelling softwares, as well as in engine tools. The key is to ensure the environment works with the story being told, sometimes even becoming its own character.

## Game Tester

Game testers help to identify bugs and issues, as well as overall enjoyment, of a game. They are less likely to play a game in development start to finish, but rather focus in on a specific mechanic, level, area, or aspect of the game. They write detailed reports of what they find, good or bad, to inform the team on their findings. They push limits to try and break the game and, if they succeed, detail what they did, how the game broke, were they able to recreate the issue, and what they could see as a potential fix. The need to be thorough, but timely, as their part in the timeline can effect the rest of production and release.

## Level Designer

Level designers create the blueprint which informs the environmental artists. The also work closely with the gameplay programmers and designers to build a cohessive world. This isn't just the backgrounds and artwork, but the enemy placement, environmental puzzles and challenges, secrets, and other things that transform each area from a place and into an interactive world. They help inform the flow of events and motivate player actions to move the game forward.
