## Gameplay Programmer

This type of programmer is focussed in on the gameplay mechanics. They take the direction from the lead designers, coupled with the ideas of the writers, to make mechanics that make sense in game. Their also focused on balancing and tuning gameplay. This means that they review bug reports throughout development and post launch to help optimize the game. A gamplay programmer, not only has the job of helping the game work, but also the job of keeping the game working for as long as it is supported.

## Game Engine Programmer

More common as a standalone group of programmers in years past, the Game Engine programmer develops the engine in which the game runs. More modernly, this position is one for specific engine familiarity. In the case of the former, these programmers will lay the groundwork which runs the game as it is developed. With the latter, these programmers will have a high level of knowledge on the specific uses and ways to work within specific engines. Depending on the engine, this could mean a high level of coding experience, or the capacity to understand the interactions of simplified programming forms (i.e. Blueprint).

## Environmental Artist

These individuals help to create the worlds in which a game takes place. They work closely with creative directors and level designers to map out landscapes, either 2D or 3D, that suit the game. They can work with various photo editing softwares, 3D modelling softwares, as well as in engine tools. The key is to ensure the environment works with the story being told, sometimes even becoming its own character.

## Game Tester

Game testers help to identify bugs and issues, as well as overall enjoyment, of a game. They are less likely to play a game in development start to finish, but rather focus in on a specific mechanic, level, area, or aspect of the game. They write detailed reports of what they find, good or bad, to inform the team on their findings. They push limits to try and break the game and, if they succeed, detail what they did, how the game broke, were they able to recreate the issue, and what they could see as a potential fix. The need to be thorough, but timely, as their part in the timeline can effect the rest of production and release.

## Level Designer

Level designers create the blueprint which informs the environmental artists. The also work closely with the gameplay programmers and designers to build a cohessive world. This isn't just the backgrounds and artwork, but the enemy placement, environmental puzzles and challenges, secrets, and other things that transform each area from a place and into an interactive world. They help inform the flow of events and motivate player actions to move the game forward.

## Sound Designer

The games soundtrack is the product of the sound designers efforts. This can include musical score, but is definately the sound effects and foley work. They can work with libraries of sound effects, or create their own with assistance. If an in game character grunts as they climb a wall, the Sound Designer works with the voice actor to get the grunt and the gameplay programmer to ensure the grunt is properly triggered. They can be involved at any point in the games production, so long as the overall intent of the soundscape is appropriately communicated.

## Creative Director

The creative director unifies the team based on the vision of the game. They are responsible for the core concepts, setting, over-arching narrative, direction of the game. They supervise the execution of that vision to ensure it is in line with their direction and has the level of quality that best represents the team and company. They need to be able to communicate the ideas effectively to a diverse team of artists, programers and executives or funders. They are involved at all stages of development, from pitch to release and should ensure each team member gets the best resources to acheive a successful launch.

## Technical Director

If the creative director ensures that a game's vision is unified and achieved, the technical director ensures the same for the technical aspects of the game. The work with the Creative Director to translate their designs into a functional game. They provide guidance to the programers, ensuring the game is functional and of high-quality. They help to identify where the teams technical shortcomings are and define how to fix those issues. As an example, a game you love was made with an in-house engine but the sequel is made usinga commercially available one like Unreal. This was a technical directors call. They would then need to ensure that any tools or platforms used can function with other tools used at every step of development. In this regard, they would also need to communicate effectively the cost of production, to include licensing, to help determine if a project is even viable.

## AI Programmer

The brains of the game sits with the AI Programmer. They help to build out non-playable character behaviors so that they act in a way that is believable within the games framework. NPCs include enemy characters and friendly characters. This programmer helps to build out the helpful NPC team mate that provides covering fire and the screen-filling boss with a predictable fight pattern. This is also a highly specialised area of programming and there is likely overlap with other programmers. 

## Marketing Manager

There are plenty of methods to marketing a game. These can range from a less is more approach, like Team Cherry regarding SilkSong, to a non-stop barrage of advertising, like every iteration of an EA Sports game. How these methods are employed is the job of a marketing manager. It is up to them to determine the target audience of the game and how best to get them excited for it, or generate hype. They coordinate the release of information via whatever means available, from social media posts up to paid adverts. In larger companies, this can be a team dedicated to ensure the highest potential profit upon release. For smaller teams, this may be figuring out how to stand out among the sea of other games releasing.
