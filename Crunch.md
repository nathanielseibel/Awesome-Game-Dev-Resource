## What is Crunch

Crunch is the compulsory overtime during a games development. This can occur at any point in a games development, but is most likely to occur closer to the games planned release date. It has been described as necessary to get games out on time by industry leaders. 

## How does it effect the Industry

As I mentioned, there are those in the industry who feel it is necessary for game development. However, the results show otherwise. Cyberpunk 2077 developer, CD Projekt Red, pledged to avoid crunch, but instead mandated six-day work weeks. They made the already delayed release date. However, when the game released it was plauged with glitches.
