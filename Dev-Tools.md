## Unreal Engine 5

This is a game engine, the 5th major version of Unreal. It is currently version 5.6 and is a very versitile engine that can be used across a number of industries. It has extremely friendly licensing options for smaller studios. Regarding UE5s infrastructure, it supports C++ but comes "out the box" utilizing Blueprint Visual Scripting. This latter option means that complex actions can be programmed without writing any code. UE5 has a number of scalable tools built in that allow users to everything from tweaking lighting, improving sound, and porting to mobile. While it has many beginner friendly options, it also has a steep learning curve with a fairly complex interface. There are tutorials available, but those can only take you so far. Additionally, it can be both CPU and GPU intensive. https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US

## MonoGame

MonoGame is an open source framework that leverages C# and other .NET languages and can be used in your editor of choice. They state Visual Studio is recommended. MonoGame continues the, now defunct, XNA support. A big pro is that it is NOT an engine, but rather a framework. This gives developers the freedom to code their own engine within this framework. It is great for 2D projects, and has been used for games like Axiom Verge as well as Salt and Sanctuary. As for cons, the flipside of being great at 2D is it struggles with 3D. Also, it lacks documentation and support. It was made for former XNA devs, and has a robust community of developer. However, it lacks any official support. https://monogame.net/

## Houdini

Houdini is primarily used as a VFX studio. However, it is being used within the games industry for procedural workflows, resulting in high-quality efffects, modeling, and world-building. This has one major con, that is, it is has an incredibly steep learning curve and is generally difficult to learn. The upside is there are many free, high quality tutorials that can help one to learn. The system brings a node-based approach and can be utilized in other engines, such as Unreal or Unity. https://www.sidefx.com/industries/games/

## Blender

Blender is a free to use, open source, 3D creation suite. It is incredibly versatile, with resources available both through the community, as well as supported by the developer. However, the learning curve is a bit steep on it and the UI isn't the most user friendly. It is not considered an industry standard and the video editing software is basic, compared to other offerings.  https://www.blender.org/

## Ogre3D

Ogre3D is an open-source graphics rendering engine written in C++. It is flexable in use, offering functional suites on all majer operating systems. Ogre offers plugin based archetecture, which allows users to add functionality without working with the core code. However, it is also not a game engine, meaning it must be used as a part, not the whole, for development. Finally, it has a steep learning curve compared to other, more robust, engines. https://www.ogre3d.org/

## Phaser

Phaser is a JavaScript Game Framework that enables developers to create web-based games. This includes games playable on Discord, or YouTube. It is fully-open source and has a user-friendly API with full documentation. The biggest downside is a it was built for web based games, so making non-web based games, i.e. mobile apps, requires a 3rd party framework. That, and if you aren't looking to make web based games, this is not the tool to use. https://phaser.io/

## SFML

Simplae and Fast Multimedia Library, or SFML, is a simple, cross-platform, and object-oriented multimedia API. It is a less established library than SDL, and therefore has a smaller user base. Despite this, it is incredibly beginner friendly and integrates seamlessly with modern C++. It also uses OpenGL and lacks DirectX support.  https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/

## GoDot

Godot is a free, lightweight, open-source game engine. Users state it has excellent 2D capabilities. While it also has 3D capabilities, some users state it isn't as robust. Additionally, it's node-based interface is considered very user friendly. The user base for Godot is smaller than that of other engines. This results in fewer community resources, tutorials, etc.  https://godotengine.org/

## Game Maker

GameMaker is a complete development tool for 2D games. While it does have a free tier, GameMaker has multiple tiers that vary in price from a one-time purchase to an annual fee. Its straightforward nature makes it ideal for prototyping, allowing for quick iteration and development.  https://gamemaker.io/en

## Unity

Unity is a game engine that is familiar to many players of Indie Games. It is considered to be very beginner friendly, with a more gentle learning curve than other options. Additionally, Unity has an extensive asset store available to users to aid in game development. However, some years ago Unity added a tiered pricing system that can be confusing and can hurt smaller teams that gain viral success. https://unity.com/
