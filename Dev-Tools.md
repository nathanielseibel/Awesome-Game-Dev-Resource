## Unreal Engine 5

This is a game engine, the 5th major version of Unreal. It is currently version 5.6 and is a very versitile engine that can be used across a number of industries. It has extremely friendly licensing options for smaller studios. Regarding UE5s infrastructure, it supports C++ but comes "out the box" utilizing Blueprint Visual Scripting. This latter option means that complex actions can be programmed without writing any code. UE5 has a number of scalable tools built in that allow users to everything from tweaking lighting, improving sound, and porting to mobile. While it has many beginner friendly options, it also has a steep learning curve with a fairly complex interface. There are tutorials available, but those can only take you so far. Additionally, it can be both CPU and GPU intensive. https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US

# NOTES

Game engines have multiple sub-systems
The game loop is the heart
Human interface devices (interactions with the user)
Editor vs Player: you can have an engine without editors (you code EVERYTHING)
The player only needs to be the part of the engine that gets used and bundle with the .exe
Translation, I don't NEED UE5 editor to run UE5 games
Frameworks vs Libraries: Framework is a group of libraries combined that serve a specific purpose (like a lower level from an engine)
Library is an isolated part that is used for specific usability
OGRE is a 3D graphics engine with no programming (framework)
Open AL is a 3d audio Library (application programming interface, NOT sound library)
