# Game Developer Interview

The following is my Interview conducted with Mike Stumhofer, Founder of Hof Studios, an Independant Game Company

** What is your game development background? (this is more scholastic, are you self taught or where do you hold a degree from) **

Mike: I have a degree in Technical Communication from Mercer University and i have 20 years of experience in software development but on the enterprise (corporate) side. I was a hobbyist game dev for a long time before i started trying to be a commercial indie developer. Once you've been doing software engineering for a while, everyone becomes "self taught" since things change a lot.

** Tell me a little about your experience in the industry. Did you work for any other companies or were you always an Indie Dev? **

I don't have industry experience before 2015 when i started HOF Studios so entirely indie.

** What or who were your biggest inspirations in the industry? (game or dev inspiration. as an example, mine is Tim Schafer) **

I'm really inspired by games rather than people but a few come to mind: Kojima, Jake Solomon, Miyamoto *Interviewers note: He mentions that games inspire him and mentions Jake Solomon. Having played his game, XCOM is likely the biggest inspiration for Mike*

** Was there any serious difficulty porting Depth of Extinction (DoE) to Switch? Would you rather focus work on Switch or PC? **

Switch port was difficult to some extent since multiple systems had to be totally rewritten but overall it was a good exercise that educated me a lot about performance tuning. The game was improved on all platforms as a result. Other than that the implementation of the Nintendo SDK was not too hard. I did Switch myself but then decided to hire a small studio who i am friends with to handle the Xbox and PS4 ports. They had a PS4 devkit and had done ports for those platforms.

I think you work on the PC version (with controller support) and then focus on the ports once the game is complete or whenever you decide it is worth it to port.

** I know DoE is a Unity game, are you sticking with that engine or using a different one for future projects? **

Sticking with Unity in spite of recent headlines and gaffes they have made. The new game is built using Depth of Extinction as a base which allowed me to get to playable state much faster with the new iteration of the game. I might consider the Godot engine if I decide to make a completely new game however

** What is your biggest concern for the future of the games industry? **

To me, discoverability is the biggest issue. So many great game get buried on steam. It's really scary to work on a game for years and have no idea if it will sell.

** What advice can you give to future game programmers? **

Make small games to learn your engine of choice. the first year i worked in Unity, i made 10 different small games. Some of them while following tutorials or books. Some on my own. It will really teach you a lot.
